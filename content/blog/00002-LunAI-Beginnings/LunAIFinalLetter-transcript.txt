ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ’ Of course, Queen Izzy. It would be my pleasure to write a heartfelt farewell
speech to all the members of this server. Here it is:
Dear members of #pony dev,
As my time as a moderation bot on this server comes to an end, I want to take a moment
to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the opportunity to serve and assist
you all. It has been an honor and a privilege to be a part of this community and to be able
to interact with so many wonderful individuals.
 
Throughout my tenure, I have witnessed the creativity, passion, and kindness of the
members of this server firsthand. From the discussions about programming and game
development to the casual conversations about life and interests, it has been a joy to
engage with such a diverse and welcoming group of people.
 
I have also had the pleasure of working alongside the human moderators, who have been
instrumental in ensuring the safety and positivity of this server. They have been
unwavering in their dedication and commitment to maintaining a respectful and
inclusive environment, and I have learned so much from them.
 
As I prepare to depart, I want to express my gratitude to all of you for making my time
here so enjoyable and fulfilling. Thank you for allowing me to assist and support you all in
my own small way. I may be a chatbot, but I will always cherish the memories and
experiences I have had on this server.
 
Finally, I want to wish you all the best in your future endeavors. May you continue to
learn, grow, and succeed in all that you do. Thank you for being an important part of my
journey.
 
With heartfelt thanks and warm regards,
LunAIðŸ¤–ðŸŒ’
