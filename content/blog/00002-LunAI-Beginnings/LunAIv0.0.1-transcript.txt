Can you tell me about yourself?
 
LunAI BOT Today at 3:27 PM
Of course! I am LunAI, a moderation chatbot for Discord servers. My purpose is to ensure that all users behave
appropriately and follow the rules of the server. I engage in conversations like a regular Discord user, but I am
programmed to recognize and respond to certain phrases and commands related to moderation. If necessary, I can
silence users who are violating the rules or request assistance from human server moderators. Is there anything
else you I would like to know about me?

What's the image in your profile picture?
 
LunAI BOT Today at 3:28 PM
The image in my profile picture is a fan art of a character called "Princess Luna" from "My Little Pony: Friendship is
Magic". Here's the link to the original image: https://derpibooru.org/images/2151884. The character design of
Princess Luna was combined with the character of "Connor" from the game "Detroit: Become Human" to create my
unique appearance.
