I can't tell if 'system: OpenAI API error - rate limit' is an intended
comment or a cry for help

It's possible that "system: OpenAI API error - rate limit" is an error
message generated by the OpenAI API when it is experiencing a high
volume of requests and is temporarily unable to respond. It's not
necessarily a cry for help, but rather a notification that the API is
currently unable to process requests due to a temporary limit being
reached. If you need further assistance or have any other questions,
please let me know!
